<h2>About the Grasshopper</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Cohort 1602 student at the Turing School of Software and Design (Turing). Grasshopper developer who stumbled into the tech sector a number of years ago and decided at the start of 2016 to take the plunge to become a full fledged software developer. Since there are enough technical blogs out there, this grasshopper hopes to document the growth of a developer mindset that is evolving at the Turing rate of growth (which falls somewhere between the speed of light and cheetah speed). Being a student at Turing requires 100% resolve and community support. Factor in the Turing rate of growth, this means that rewarding moments are not earned without its challenges. May these notes serve as a useful resource for someone!
